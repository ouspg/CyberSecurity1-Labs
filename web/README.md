# Web Hacking

This is the web hacking module for the lab.

This module uses a modified version of the OWASP Juice Shop.

## Configurations

The lab uses a docker compose file to start the juice shop service and passes `juice-shop-config.yml` as the configuration file. You can modify stuff like `title`,`name`,`logo` etc.

For the compose file, it is suggested not to update the environnment variables and volumes as they can cause other things to break.

## Setup

To setup this lab you need to have the modified version of the OWASP juice shop as a docker image.

Pull the docker image:

```bash

```

Convert it into archive. Make sure it exists under the `web` directory:

```
docker image save <>:<>
```


## Modified OWASP Juice Shop

One of the criteria of these labs was to have the capability to generate dynamic flags for students. OWASP Juice shop already has a [flag generation mechanism when run under CTF mode](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/companion-guide/latest/part4/ctf.html).

To synchroninze the flags generated by OWASP Juice Shop and the lab flag generator application under `flag_generator`, the flag generation algorithm in juice shop was updated. Refer to [Flag Generation Logic] to learn more about how the flags are generated.

The modified Juice Shop was then converted to a docker image.
